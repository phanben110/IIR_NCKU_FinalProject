## Features

- **Download PubMed**: Provides the functionality to download PubMed articles from the PubMed Central (PMC) database and save them locally for future analysis.

- **Frequency Analyst**: Offers a tool for analyzing the frequency of keywords and generating insights from the data. Additionally, it provides the ability to visualize the Zipf Distribution computation (frequency spectrum for terms).

- **Edit Distance**: Includes a feature to calculate the edit distance between keywords and terms within the articles. This is valuable for identifying approximate matches and relevant results.

## Algorithms

- **Streamlit**: The primary framework for building the user interface and integrating different features.

- **Bio.Entrez**: Integrated to interact with PubMed's database for article retrieval.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations, including Zipf Distribution plots.

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Employed for text processing, including stopword removal and stemming.

- **Porter Stemmer**: Used for text normalization.

- **Programming-Based Edit Distance Computation**: Used to compute the edit distance between keywords and terms within the articles. This is essential for identifying approximate matches and relevant results.

## Displaying Retrieval Results

The retrieval results can be displayed in a format that indicates the location(s) and/or partial matches of the search terms within the articles. This feature provides users with quick access to relevant content and helps them pinpoint specific information within the retrieved articles.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the application using Streamlit with the command `streamlit run app.py`

3. Access the web application by opening a web browser and navigating to the provided URL.
